# Fluxion by Mr. SAGE 

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/thehackingsage/Fluxion/blob/master/logos/Logo.png?raw=true" /></p>

"Fluxion is the Future of MITM WPA Attacks" It is a remake by Mr. SAGE with less bugs and more functionality. It's compatible with the latest release of Kali (rolling). The attack is mostly manual, but experimental versions will automatically handle most functionality from the stable releases. (https://thehackingsage.github.io/Fluxion/)

## How It Works :

* Scan the networks.
* Capture a handshake (can't be used without a valid handshake, it's necessary to verify the password)
* Use WEB Interface
* Launch a FakeAP instance to imitate the original access point
* Spawns a MDK3 process, which deauthenticates all users connected to the target network, so they can be lured to connect to the FakeAP and enter the WPA password.
* A fake DNS server is launched in order to capture all DNS requests and redirect them to the host running the script
* A captive portal is launched in order to serve a page, which prompts the user to enter their WPA password
* Each submitted password is verified by the handshake captured earlier
* The attack will automatically terminate, as soon as a correct password is submitted..
